	<h2> MY FIRST EVER CRUISE</h2>
	<p> <i> <small> March 10, 2018 </small> </i></p>
	<p>
		I joined a cruise for the first time, thanks to the good people behind SuperStar Virgo. I don’t know why it took me this long to try a cruise. Maybe it’s because I was scared of feeling claustrophobic in a ship? The thought of  getting cooped up in a tiny cabin for days doesn’t make cruising sound so appealing to me. But then all that went away when I saw the huge ship that is SuperStar Virgo. It is Star Cruise’s fleet flagship after all. </p>

		<p>After only one night of cruising, I woke up and found myself in Taiwan. We joined another shore excursion arranged by SuperStar Virgo namely, the Shifen Scenic Tour. We chose this tour because most of us in our group have already been to Taipei’s city center. This tour offered sights we haven’t seen before like the Shifen Waterfalls, Pingxi Old Street (where the famous old railway lined with lantern shops is) and the Keelung Miaokou Street for more shopping and local delicacies. Frankly, just getting to eat Taiwanese street food again was enough to make me happy. </p>

<p>Overall, it was a good first cruise experience for me. The seas were calm. The weather was great. We enjoyed the ship’s facilities, joined games, relaxed, ate, slept and boom! We were already at our destination the next day–ready to be toured around by our guides. It’s the easiest travel experience! We didn’t have to think or worry about anything the entire time. If you’re traveling with a big group of friends or family, you should definitely consider going on a cruise.

	<h2> LONDON CHECKLIST</h2> 
	<p> <i> <small> May 2, 2018 </small></i></p> 
	<p>
		This post is going to be filled with all the London tourist clichés and no, I refuse to apologize for being so touristy because… I’m a tourist after all. LOL. </p>

<p>We then had enough time to just shop and unwind around Neal’s Yard, Covent Garden, Monmouth Street and the surrounding streets. These are a bunch of small streets that are all close together so everything we did today, we did by foot. And yes, all while wearing my fancy #CoexistByCamilleCo dress. Honestly, I felt especially proud walking around London in my own creation– all the more when random strangers would come up to me and ask me where I got my dress. “Um, I designed it.” Insert big smile here. Eeeeep! </p>

	<p>Our day ended with an awesome night at the Prince of Wales Theater. I’ve always wanted to watch the Book of Mormon but it’s impossible to book in New York. Good thing I was able to get us seats here instead. I forgot about my jetlag the moment the show started. I honestly think I’ve never laughed this much watching a musical! I highly recommend it. </p>

	<h2> PORTOBELLO ROAD </h2> 
	<p> <i> <small> June 23, 2018 </small></i></p> 
	<p>
		Portobello Road is no stranger to most people, especially if you’re old enough to remember the 1999 classic Notting Hill. It’s famous for its market and charming little stores, selling everything from vintage clothes and antique items to electronics, accessories, artworks and street food. It used to be just a fruit and veggies market back in the day but slowly evolved into the market it is now, loved by locals and tourists alike.</p>

<p>I read online that it’s best to go to Portobello Market early in the morning–Saturdays if you’re into antiques as it’s the main trading day but if not, Friday is a good day too. I wasn’t really going for the shopping though (Gasp! I know, I’m full of surprises!) so it didn’t really matter much to me. I was mainly there for the gorgeous architecture and to take photos of all the little knick knacks I find along the way (like beautiful vintage jewelry and home decor). The pretty pastel building lined streets of Notting Hill were on the agenda as well so I was just strolling around the area and taking my own sweet time before finally making my way to the Kensington Gardens. It was the perfect introduction to London–especially for one who’s yet to adjust to jet lag. </p>
